        "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in both men and women and it was estimated that in 2003 nearly 150,000 cases would be diagnosed and 57,000 people would die. Screening has been accepted as a means for early detection of the disease, yet only a portion of the eligible population undergoes colorectal cancer screening, partially due to comfort issues of undergoing a full colonoscopic examination. Virtual colonoscopy (VC) has been demonstrated to be an effective means of performing screening and given the number of people who are candidate for screening better tools, such as Computer Aided Detection (CAD), are required to fulfill this increasing need. The developed CAD system, presented in this paper, has focused on the detection of polyps of sizes up to and including 20 mm. The results have demonstrated that: the developed algorithm generalizes, the sensitivity and specificity for middle- to large-sized polyps is on the average 95% while the overall sensitivity is roughly 88% and the false positive has remained at a manageable 4 per volume.",

        "title": "Semantics and CBIR: a medical imaging perspective",
        "abstract": "Medical CBIR (content-based image retrieval) applications pose unique challenges but at the same time offer many new opportunities. On one hand, while one can easily understand news or sports videos, a medical image is often completely incomprehensible to untrained eyes. On the other hand, semantics in the medical domain is much better defined and there is a vast accumulation of formal knowledge representations that could be exploited to support semantic search for any specialty areas in medicine.\n In this paper, however, we will not dwell on any one particular specialty area, but rather address the question of how to support scalable semantic search across the whole of medical CBIR field: what are the advantages to take and gaps to fill, what are the key enabling technologies, and the critical success factor from an industrial point of view.\n In terms of enabling technologies, we discuss three aspects: 1. anatomical, disease, and contextual semantics, and their representations using ontologies; 2. scalable image analysis and tagging algorithms; and 3. ontological reasoning and its role in guiding and improving image analysis and retrieval.\n More specifically, for ontological representation of medical imaging semantics, we discuss the potential use of FMA, RadLex, ICD, and AIM. For scalable image analysis we present a learning-based anatomy detection and segmentation framework using distribution-free priors. It is easily adaptable to different anatomies and different imaging modalities.",
