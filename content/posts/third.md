In this post, I will demonstrate mostly my skills in using the markdown langauge. I will basically try to copy Lil'Log's post, and practice with various useful formatting methods like headers, quotes, questions, lists, and the like. I hope you all enjoy!

## Overview of Existing Material
There are many tutorials online. I particularly like using https://dillinger.io. It's an online editor, and a nice intro to what I can use. Now I will work on creating a list below.

### A Review of citation-method

These first three links are embedded using a citation-like method
- [Monik Gruber][monik] writes on the [his blog][monik], RNNS are pretty cool
- [Andrew Trask][trask-bio] [has a site][trask] where he describes a basic RNN using python code
- And of course, who could forget Lilian Weng's [awesome site][weng-blog] that inspired me to do the same

### A review of direct method

Now the next three likes will use embedded links, but without the citation method (directly attatched)
- here is [a wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) about Nikola Tesla
- There's [a site](https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links) that describes how to use links with markup
- Finally, a link to [the famous book](https://readmake.com) by Pieter Levels; it's worth a read

Let's see how these two methods compare!

## Verdict: Review of embedded link methods

It definately seems much clearner to have the links separated, rather than right with the text. Just my personal preference, but I think I will go with the citation method


[//]: # (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job. There is no need to format nicely because it shouldn't be seen. Thanks SO - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/store-comments-in-markdown-syntax)
