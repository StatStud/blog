# Introduction
The purpose of this post is to provide readers a quick recap on the [S2AND paper by Allen AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07534.pdf). Readers are encouraged to review the original paper for technical details they wish to further investigate. Additionally, Daniel King and Sergey Feldman have done a great job documenting S2AND development in a [separate Medium post](https://blog.allenai.org/s2and-an-improved-author-disambiguation-system-for-semantic-scholar-d09380da30e6) by Sergey Feldman.

For a post demonstrating the implementation of S2AND, feel free to read [the second part](https://google.com) of this post.
