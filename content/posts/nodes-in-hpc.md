# What is a node?
A node in HPC refers to a single computational unit within a larger cluster or supercomputer. It typically consists of one or more processors (CPUs) and may include other components such as memory, storage, and accelerators like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). 

HPC nodes are designed for high-performance parallel computing and are often part of a larger cluster or supercomputer infrastructure. 

Nodes are interconnected within the HPC system to enable communication and coordination between them, forming a highly parallel and distributed computing infrastructure. They are optimized for executing large-scale, computationally intensive tasks that require significant processing power, such as simulations, data analysis, or complex scientific calculations.

Each node functions as an independent entity within the cluster, capable of executing its own tasks and collaborating with other nodes to perform complex computations.

## How does a single node compare to a household computer?

In a typical household computer, a node in HPC terms would be comparable to the combination of the CPU, memory, storage, and other components within that computer; it represents a self-contained computational unit capable of executing tasks and running software applications.

You could create a "personal cluster" with household computers; you would typically need networking capabilities to interconnect the computers and a cluster management software or middleware to coordinate the distribution of tasks and resources among the nodes. Networking can be achieved through wired Ethernet connections or wireless connections, depending on the available infrastructure.
